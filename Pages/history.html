            At Slovenské Vzdelávacie Centrum – South Manchester, we are proud to be qualified educators with extensive experience across various educational settings. Our goal is to provide a student-centred, engaging, and culturally enriching learning environment, where language learning goes hand in hand with cultural education.

        <td>
            We believe that language and culture are inseparable, which is why our curriculum aligns with our cultural events and workshops. This approach ensures that students not only learn Slovak in the classroom but also experience it in real-life situations. While these events are part of our curriculum, they are also open to members who wish to attend workshops only, providing flexibility to suit individual interests.</td>
